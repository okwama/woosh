# Product Page Optimizations

## UI/UX Improvements

### Loading States & Visual Feedback
- Implemented skeleton loading UI for initial data fetch
- Added placeholder cards that match the exact layout of product cards
- Reduced loading indicator stroke width for subtle visual feedback
- Maintained consistent card dimensions to prevent layout shifts
- Added smooth transitions between loading states

### Image Loading Optimizations
- Implemented `CachedNetworkImage` for efficient image loading
- Added placeholder with thin progress indicator during image load
- Images are cached locally for instant subsequent loads
- Proper error states for failed image loads
- Optimized image dimensions for grid layout

### Search Functionality
- Implemented client-side filtering for immediate results
- Added debounced search input (500ms delay)
- Clear button for search input
- Empty state UI with helpful messages
- Maintained server-side pagination while filtering

### Pagination
- Implemented infinite scroll with bottom loading indicator
- Server-side pagination with 20 items per page
- Smooth loading of additional items
- Visual feedback when loading more items
- Proper error handling for failed loads

## Performance Optimizations
