# Session Management System

## Overview
The session management system has been updated to use manual session control instead of automatic session creation during login. This allows users to explicitly start and end their work sessions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Login Process
- Removed automatic session creation during login
- Now only stores user ID for later use
- Login process is simplified and focused on authentication only

### 2. Profile Page Updates
- Added a dedicated session control button
- Positioned at the bottom center of the profile page
- Width set to 200 pixels for better visibility
- Includes visual feedback for session state

### 3. Session Button Features
- **Visual States**:
  - Green "Start Session" when no session is active
  - Red "End Session" when a session is active
  - Loading indicator during processing
  - Color-coded icons and text

- **Positioning**:
  - Fixed at bottom of screen
  - Proper padding for device safe areas
  - Centered horizontally
  - Clean, minimal design

### 4. Session Management Flow
1. User logs in (no session created)
2. User navigates to profile page
3. User can manually:
   - Start session (creates loginAt timestamp)
   - End session (creates logoutAt timestamp)
4. Session status is persisted and visible in UI
5. Session history remains accessible

### 5. Error Handling
- Proper error messages for failed operations
- Visual feedback through snackbars
- Loading states during processing
- Null safety checks for user ID

## Technical Implementation

### Session Service Methods
```dart
// Start a new session
static Future<Map<String, dynamic>> recordLogin(String userId)

// End current session
static Future<Map<String, dynamic>> recordLogout(String userId)

// Get session history
static Future<Map<String, dynamic>> getSessionHistory(String userId)
```

### State Management
- Uses GetX for state management
- Maintains session status in local state
- Persists user ID in GetStorage
- Handles loading and error states

## UI Components
- Session button with dynamic states
- Loading indicator
- Success/error snackbars
- Color-coded feedback

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient state management
- Proper error handling
- Loading states for better UX
- Caching of session data

## Future Improvements
- Add session duration display
- Implement session timeout
- Add session statistics
- Enhance error recovery

## Usage
1. Navigate to Profile page
2. Use the session button at the bottom to:
   - Start session (green button)
   - End session (red button)
3. View session history in the dedicated section
4. Monitor session status through visual indicators
